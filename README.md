Change-Wordpress-Email
======================

This plugin allows you to set the From header on emails sent by WP,
since the mail-from plugin on the wp.org site apparently doesn't 
work with new WordPress versions.

Just move mailfrom.php into the wp-content/plugins folder and enable
it in WP admin. Tested with WP 3.4.2.
